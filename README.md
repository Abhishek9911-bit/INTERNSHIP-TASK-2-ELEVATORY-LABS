Phishing Email Simulation & Detection Analysis

This project documents a phishing email simulation created to test
detection mechanisms using a *Netflix billing scam scenario. It
demonstrates how phishing traits can be identified through **manual
header analysis* and automated spam detection tools.

📌 Project Overview

-   Simulation Type: Netflix Billing Scam
-   Sender Address Used: netflixbilling1@gmail.com
-   Subject Line: “Billing Update Required Verify Your Netflix Details”
-   Phishing Method: Urgent account suspension notice with a Google
    Forms link for fake payment verification.

🔍 Key Findings

-   Suspicious sender domain (free Gmail instead of official Netflix
    domain).
-   Urgent threat tone to create panic.
-   Missing/invalid headers (Message-ID, Received headers).
-   Suspicious links redirecting to Google Forms instead of Netflix.
-   High SpamAssassin score (5.10) indicating strong phishing traits.

📑 Conclusion

The simulation highlights how phishing detection improves when manual
checks are combined with automated spam analysis. Awareness training,
robust filtering, and simulations like this are essential for
strengthening email security.# INTERNSHIP-TASK-2-ELEVATORY-LABS
